# Daily Photo Enhancement Process

## Overview
This process adds real Google Places photos to restaurants that don't have any photos yet. To stay within the free tier limits, we process exactly 100 restaurants per day.

## Current Status
- **Total African Restaurants**: 2,889
- **With Photos**: 348 (12.0%)
- **Without Photos**: 2,541 (88.0%)
- **Estimated Completion**: 26 days (October 16, 2025)
